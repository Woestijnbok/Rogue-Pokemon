# About
Rogue Pokémon is a small project that me and a friend [Tijl Gommers](https://be.linkedin.com/in/tijl-gommers-661572316 "LinkedIn Profile") made as a side project.
Since we are both fans of the old Pokémon games we created a small world where you can move around using the arrow keys.

Sometimes you will encounter a pokémon in the grasses which you have to fight with your Charizard.
During the battle you can select and confirm you moves using the arrow keys and space bar.

After you defeated a set amount of pokémons you will go to a different randomly generated level. The randomniss here are the grasses, pokémon balls and pokémons.
Important to know is that your pokemon does not heal after battling that's why you can find heals for your pokémon in the pokémon balls.

Hope you have fun!

P.S. There are legendary pokémons which only show themself to proven trainers.
