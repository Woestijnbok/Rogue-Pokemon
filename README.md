# Introduction

Rogue Pokémon is a collaborative side project developed by myself and my friend, [Tijl Gommers](https://be.linkedin.com/in/tijl-gommers-661572316 "LinkedIn Profile"). 
Our shared passion for the classic Pokémon games inspired us to create a small, interactive world where players can engage in exploration and battles using familiar mechanics.

# Controls

You can more around and face off against Pokémons in the levels. 
The controls are designed to be intuitive and simple for quick, responsive gameplay.

- **Movement**: Use **ARROW** keys for navigation.
- **Menu**: Use **ARROW** keys to select your menu option and **SPACE** to confirm them.

# Battles

Sometimes you will encounter a pokémon in the grasses which you have to fight with your Charizard.
The pokémons you encounter will not always be the same and can jump to other grass tiles.

# Levels

After defeating a certain number of Pokémons, players transition to a new, randomly generated level.
The randomness enhances replayability, as the arrangement of grass, Pokémon balls, and Pokémon varies with each playthrough.

An essential aspect of gameplay is that your Pokémon do not heal automatically after battles.
To aid in recovery, players can find healing items within Pokémon balls scattered throughout the levels.

# Final Thoughts

We hope you enjoy **Rogue Pokémon** as much as we enjoyed creating it! The game incorporates classic elements of Pokémon gameplay while introducing unique mechanics, such as the randomness of levels and the necessity of finding healing items.

P.S. There are legendary pokémons which only show themself to proven trainers.
