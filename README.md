# About
Rogue Pokémon is a small project that me and a friend [Tijl Gommers](https://be.linkedin.com/in/tijl-gommers-661572316 "LinkedIn Profile") made as a side project.
Since we are both fans of the old Pokémon games we created a small world where you can move around using the arrow keys. Sometimes you will encounter a pokémon in the grasses.
After you defeated a set amount of pokémons you will go to a different randomly generated level. The randomniss here are the grasses, pokémon balls and which grasses contain pokémons.
Important to know is that your pokemon does not heal after battling that's why you can find heals for your pokémon in the pokémon balls. You only have one pokémons and it's always the same one Charizard who doesn't like him.

Hope you have fun!

P.S. There are legendary pokémons which only show themself to proven trainers.
